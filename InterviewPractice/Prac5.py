# Orginal Code: a = [1, 2, 3] b = a a += [4, 5] print(a, b)



# Orginal code modifed to fix the syntax error below:
# a = [1, 2, 3] 
# b = a +[4, 5] 
# print(a, b) // wrong



a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a 
a += [4, 5]
print(a, b)  # Corrected the syntax error by using '+' for concatenation

"""
Answer: Error, As per the original code, it would throw a SyntaxError.

a = [1, 2, 3] → create list.

b = a → both a and b point to the same list.

a += [4, 5] → modifies the list in place (extend), so both see the change.

print(a, b) → both show [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
