# Orginal Code: a = [1, 2, 3] b = a a += [4, 5] print(a, b)



# Orginal code modifed to fix the syntax error below:
a = [1, 2, 3] 
b = a +[4, 5] 
print(a, b)

"""
Answer: Error, As per the original code, it would throw a SyntaxError.

The code threw a SyntaxError due to an incorrect operator.

Orginal code modified

After fixing it with b = a + [4, 5], the output becomes 
 [1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
This demonstrates that Python list concatenation returns 
a new list while keeping the original unchanged.
