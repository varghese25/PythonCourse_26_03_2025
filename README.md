#  Run Jupyter (without worrying about PATH)

After installation, instead of jupyter notebook, run:

C:\Users\u>python -m notebook

In Python, the -m flag means:
👉 “Run a module as a script.”

This directly tells Python to launch Jupyter, so you don’t need PATH set up yet.

👉 If it works, your browser will open at:

http://localhost:8888/tree
